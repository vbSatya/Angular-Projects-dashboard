  Create a Parent application
  Should have a dashboard screen with links to child apps
  Route configs 2 child apps

  Create 2 more child applications using Angular Library
  Each app should contain its own Routing

  Child apps should be integrated into parent application as packages using package.json

  Style sheets should be loaded on demand
    If I access Child app 1, then only stylesheet specific to that app should load. Likewise for app 2

  Navigation between parent and child apps should be seamless just like regular Angular SPA app.

  Create code to dynamically up / down application based on API data. Eg: We have to show some message to user dynamically based on API data
  
  For a application with Parent & Child structure, we should be able to up/down whole application or any specific application by modifying config in API response.
